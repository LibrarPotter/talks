## What did I miss?

What's the "word" on campus? What are leaders talking about? 

# Before we continue ... 

## Let's look at a example 

Of great storytelling, that happens to use data. *The Post and Courier* [Tell death do us part](http://www.postandcourier.com/tilldeath/partone.html)

## Thoughts? 

## People

People. It is about people. 

## No, really, it's about people

# Your Story  

## You have [data stories](http://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-us/data) already. 

Are you happy with them? 

## Case Study 1 - [Snowpocalypse](http://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-us/data/snow-days-tisch)

+ What is good about this story? 
+ What data is being used? 
+ What type of data is missing? 

## Case Study 1 + Tuft's mission

Tufts is a **student-centered research** university dedicated to the creation and application of knowledge.

+ Is this student-centered or what? 
+ What could be added to further connect this story with your narrative 

## Case Study 2 - [Research Consultations](http://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-us/data/research-consultations)

+ What is the context? 
+ What is the "so-what?" 

## Case Study 2 + Tuft's Value Proposition

... that will push the boundaries of, and **reinvent** the methodologies for, how we **teach**, **learn** and conduct **research**

+ Has the Research Hub reinvented how you teach information literacy? 
+ Has the Research Hub reinvented how students learn and conduct research? 
+ Are these transformative experiences? 

# What have we learned? 

## What could be improved upon? 

## Who can help? 

# Final Thoughts 

## Mission + Context + People -> Compelling Stories 

## People = Data
